# Raxdog

Raxdog is a work-in-progress pipeline aimed to reconstruct accurate genes trees and species trees from genes families, under the duplications and losses model.

We plan to use raxml-ng to generate hight quality starting genes trees, and then Phyldog to refine them while building a species tree.
